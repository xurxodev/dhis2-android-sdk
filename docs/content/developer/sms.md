# SMS module { #android_sdk_sms_module }

SMS Module can be used as a fallback method to upload data when an Internet connection is not available. It requires an additional setup in the server: an SMS gateway must be configured in the server to be able to receive SMS; optionally, the server might have the capability to send SMS back to the clients with the response.

Depending on the mobile provider, sending SMS might imply an extra cost. For this reason, SMS Module is only intended for **granular data upload**. It is not used for metadata download or bulk data download/upload. Additionally, the data is compressed by using the [SMS compression library](https://github.com/dhis2/sms-compression) so the content can fit in a lower number of messages. This library is shared with the backend.

For testing purposes you can use the [DHIS2 Android SMS Gateway](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-sms-android-gateway).

In the SDK, the SMS module can be accessed from `D2`.

```java
d2.smsModule()
```

This module is **disabled by default** and it must be explicitly enabled and configured. It includes three components that give access to module features.

- ConfigCase: it is used to set initial data that is common for all sms sending tasks like gateway numbers, timeout, execute downloading
of metadata ids object.
- SmsSubmitCase. it is used to convert the *DHIS2* data that will be sent by the Sdk, to send it by SMS and to check the progress of the submission and his result.
- QrCodeCase: it is used to convert *DHIS2* data to String. This String is a compressed representation of the *DHIS2* data. This is useful to avoid send large content on SMSes.

A typical workflow to use the SMS Module would be like:

- Enable the SMS module.
- Sync metadata. The SMS Module downloads additional metadata from the server, so this step must be done while Internet connection is available and **after** the module is enabled.
- Send data using SMS Module.

This a code example of a typical workflow (it used blocking methods for code simplicity):

```java
// Enable SMS Module
d2.smsModule().configCase().setModuleEnabled(true).blockingAwait();

// Sync SMS Module metadata using SMS Module
d2.smsModule().configCase().refreshMetadataIds().blockingAwait();
// or using metadata module
d2.metadataModule().blockingDownload();

// Configure, at least, the gateway number. See ConfigCase for more parameters
d2.smsModule().configCase().setGatewayNumber("gateway-number").blockingAwait();

// Send data. For example a tracker event:
SmsSubmitCase case = d2.smsModule().smsSubmitCase();
Integer numSMSs = case.convertTrackerEvent("event-uid").blockingGet();

case.send().blockingSubscribe();
```
> **Important**

> The app is responsible for asking the user for permissions (READ_PHONE_STATE, SEND_SMS, READ_SMS, RECEIVE_SMS). Otherwise, SMS module will fail.

## SMS version { #android_sdk_sms_version }

SMSs are sent in a compressed format from/to the server. This task is done by the [SMS Compression library](https://github.com/dhis2/sms-compression), which is responsible for doing the conversion between the plain text and the compressed format.

The SDK includes the latest available version of the compression library, but there is no guarantee that the server is using it as well. For this reason, it is required to check the server version in order to enable/disable some functionalities. The SMS version in the server can be checked by:

```java
d2.systemInfoModule().versionManager().getSmsVersion()
```

Overview of versions - features:

Version 1:

- Aggregated data.
- Tracker / event data, but there are some known bugs. We recommend not to enable tracker SMS sync in version 1.

Version 2:

- Add support for empty lists.
- Add support for geometry in events (POINT).
- Add missing properties in events (event data, due date) and enrollments (execution date, incident date).
- Add support for sending enrollment + events in the same SMS submit case.

For more information, please check [SMS compression repository](https://github.com/dhis2/sms-compression).

## ConfigCase { #android_sdk_sms_config_case }

```java
d2.smsModule().configCase()
```

Use this case to configure the SMS Module before using it. It is required, at least, to:

- Enable the module.
- Set a gateway number.
- Download the metadata ids.

There are other optional parameters to control if the SDK should wait a response from the server or not and the response timeout. Also, it is possible to specify the sender number so messages received from other senders are ignored.

## SmsSubmitCase { #android_sdk_sms_submit_case }

Use this case to create a new submission and send it. Submission cases are not reusable and can only be sent once. To create a new submission case call the method:

```java
SmsSubmitCase case = d2.smsModule().smsSubmitCase();
```

A submission involve the following steps:

- Specify the data to submit. This means to call a method like `convert*()`.
- Send the message.
- Optionally check for confirmation SMS.

As an example, sending a tracker event will be like:

```java
SmsSubmitCase case = d2.smsModule().smsSubmitCase();
Integer numSMSs = case.convertTrackerEvent("event-uid").blockingGet();

case.send().blockingSubscribe();
```

The next methods can be used to set the *DHIS2* data to send:

- `convertSimpleEvent()`. To set a simple event.
- `convertTrackerEvent()`. To set a tracker event.
- `convertEnrollment()`. To set an enrollment.
- `convertDataSet()`. To set a data set.
- `convertRelationship()`. To set a relationship.
- `convertDeletion()`. To delete an event.

The methods above returns a single with the number of messages that the
items takes up. An example of the use of these methods is shown in the
next snippet.

```java
Single<Integer> convertTask = d2.smsModule().smsSubmitCase()
    .convertEnrollment("enrollment_uid")
```

To send the data converted earlier the Sdk provides a `send()` method
that returns a stream of the current states. Also it is possible to get
the submission id by calling the method `getSubmissionId()`.

```java
d2.smsModule().smsSubmitCase().send()
```

It is also possible to wait for the SMS result by calling the
`checkConfirmationSms()` method. It returns a `Completable` object where
completion means that the SMS was received successfully. In case that
the result cannot be found, it returns an error. The date accepted is
the minimum date for which confirmation is going to be checked, this is
used to skip old messages that may have the same submission id.

```java
d2.smsModule().smsSubmitCase().checkConfirmationSms(new Date());
```

These methods can fail and return a `PreconditionFailed` object if some
conditions are not satisfied. The preconditions errors are:

- `NO_NETWORK`.
- `NO_CHECK_NETWORK_PERMISSION`.
- `NO_RECEIVE_SMS_PERMISSION`.
- `NO_SEND_SMS_PERMISSION`.
- `NO_GATEWAY_NUMBER_SET`.
- `NO_USER_LOGGED_IN`.
- `NO_METADATA_DOWNLOADED`.
- `SMS_MODULE_DISABLED`.

## QrCodeCase { #android_sdk_sms_qr_code_case }

```java
d2.smsModule().qrCodeCase()
```

Use this method to obtain a compressed representation of the data.

`QrCodeCase` can convert the next type of *DHIS2* objects:

- **Simple events**. Using the `generateSimpleEventCode()` method and passing an event uid.
- **Tracker events**. Using the `generateTrackerEventCode()` method and passing an event uid. 
- **Enrollments**. Using the `generateEnrollmentCode()` method and passing an enrollment uid.
- **Relationships**. Using the `generateRelationshipCode()` method and passing a relationship uid.
- **Data sets**. Using the `generateDataSetCode()` method and passing a data set uid, an organisation unit uid, an attribute option combo and a period id.
  
Also it is possible to get compressed strings that can be used to delete events:

- **Deletions**. Using the `generateDeletionCode()` method and passing the uid of the event.
  
These methods returns a `Single` with the compressed data. The next code snippet shows an example of how it can be used.

```java
Single<String> convertTask = d2.smsModule().qrCodeCase().generateEnrollmentCode(enrollmentUid);
```
